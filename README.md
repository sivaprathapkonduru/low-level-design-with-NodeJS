### üïí **Total Estimated Time:**

‚úÖ **8 weeks (2 months)** ‚Äì **if you spend 1-2 hours daily**
‚úÖ If you have more time (e.g., 3-4 hours/day), you can finish faster (\~1 month!)

---

### üî• **Tips to Become a Pro in LLD**

‚úÖ **Design systems from scratch:**

* Pick popular systems (e.g., e-commerce, social media app)
* Try LLD multiple times with different trade-offs

‚úÖ **Use UML tools** ‚Äì Lucidchart, draw\.io, or pen & paper

‚úÖ **Get feedback** ‚Äì Share your designs with peers or mentors for review

‚úÖ **Iterate!** ‚Äì Redo your design after feedback. Pro designers constantly iterate.
