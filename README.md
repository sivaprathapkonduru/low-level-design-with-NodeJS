# low-level-design-with-NodeJS

### 🚀 **Phases & Timeline**

1️⃣ **Beginner Basics (1 week)**

* **Topics:** OOP concepts, UML basics, SOLID principles, system thinking
* **Goal:** Understand core concepts and notations

2️⃣ **Intermediate LLD (2 weeks)**

* **Topics:** Class diagrams, sequence diagrams, state diagrams, design patterns
* **Goal:** Start designing small-scale systems confidently

3️⃣ **Hands-on Practice (2 weeks)**

* **Topics:** Practice LLD for real-world examples (e.g., URL shortener, cab booking)
* **Goal:** Get comfortable turning requirements into classes/interfaces

4️⃣ **Advanced & Pro Level (3 weeks)**

* **Topics:** Handling edge cases, scalability, trade-offs, advanced patterns (like CQRS, event sourcing), performance considerations
* **Goal:** Design complex systems like Netflix, WhatsApp, payment gateways

---

### 🕒 **Total Estimated Time:**

✅ **8 weeks (2 months)** – **if you spend 1-2 hours daily**
✅ If you have more time (e.g., 3-4 hours/day), you can finish faster (\~1 month!)

---

### 🔥 **Tips to Become a Pro in LLD**

✅ **Design systems from scratch:**

* Pick popular systems (e.g., e-commerce, social media app)
* Try LLD multiple times with different trade-offs

✅ **Use UML tools** – Lucidchart, draw\.io, or pen & paper

✅ **Get feedback** – Share your designs with peers or mentors for review

✅ **Iterate!** – Redo your design after feedback. Pro designers constantly iterate.

Awesome! Here’s a **detailed 8-week roadmap to go from beginner to pro in Low-Level Design (LLD)** — tailored for daily or weekly tracking.

| **1** | 🛠️ **Basics**                               | - OOP principles (Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation, Abstraction)  <br>- UML basics (Class, Sequence, State diagrams)  <br>- SOLID principles | Build a solid foundation in LLD basics                |
| **2** | 🏗️ **LLD Fundamentals**                     | - Class diagrams in detail  <br>- Sequence diagrams  <br>- Aggregation, Composition, Inheritance relationships                                       | Understand how to model relationships between classes |
| **3** | 💡 **Design Patterns**                       | - Common patterns: Singleton, Factory, Builder, Observer, Adapter, Decorator  <br>- When to use them and trade-offs                                  | Learn to apply patterns in real-world scenarios       |
| **4** | 🚀 **Small System Designs**                  | - Design a URL shortener (tiny, but complete system!)  <br>- Focus on classes, interactions, dependencies                                            | Practice end-to-end small system design               |
| **5** | 🔥 **More Real-World Designs**               | - Design a cab booking system (e.g., Uber)  <br>- Booking, driver matching, ride status flow                                                         | Apply LLD to slightly more complex systems            |
| **6** | ⚡ **Edge Cases & Advanced Patterns**         | - Handle edge cases (errors, concurrency, retries)  <br>- Advanced patterns (CQRS, Event sourcing)                                                   | Learn to think of robustness and maintainability      |
| **7** | 🛡️ **Performance & Scaling Considerations** | - How to design for performance  <br>- Bottlenecks, trade-offs, caching in LLD                                                                       | Add depth to your LLD thinking                        |
| **8** | 🌟 **Polish & Practice**                     | - Revisit all designs: Identify improvements  <br>- Mock interviews & whiteboard practice  <br>- Document your designs for sharing                   | Solidify concepts and gain confidence                 |

### 🎯 **Additional Tips for Pro-Level**

✅ Take **mock interviews** on LLD with a friend / mentor
✅ Solve LLD **case studies** (like Netflix, WhatsApp, e-commerce)
✅ Focus on **trade-offs** — pros & cons of each design choice
✅ **Iterate** — redesign the same system multiple times to find better solutions
