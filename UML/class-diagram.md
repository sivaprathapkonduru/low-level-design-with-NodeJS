## 🧠 1. What is a Class Diagram?

- It is a static diagram

- Shows structure of the system

- Represents:

    - Classes

    - Attributes

    - Methods

    - Relationships

👉 It is the **BACKBONE of OOP and LLD**

## 🏗 2. Basic Structure of a Class

### Format:

| ClassName |
| ---------- |
| `-` attributes <br> `+` **name: string**(public) <br> `-` **age: int**(private) <br> `#` **mobile: tel**(protected) <br> `~` **capitalizer: package**(local package)|
| `+` **methods**(**in** **id**: number, **out** ) |


### Operations Visibility (or) Access modifiers:

- `+` Public
- `-` Private
- `#` Protected
- `~` Local Package

### Parameter directionality:

| Kind |	Meaning |	Example |
| --------- | -------- | -------- |
| in	| **Input**: Passed to method, unchanged	| +borrowBook(**in** isbn: String)
| out	| **Output**: Modified by method, returned	| +generateTicket(**out** ticketId: String)
| inout |	**Both**: Input + modified output	| +updateSpot(**inout** spot: ParkingSpot)

## ex:-

### I. Library System (Your Day 1)

>
<pre> class LibraryService {
  +borrowBook(
    **in** memberId: string,      // Member scans card (input)
    **in** isbn: string,          // Book barcode (input)
    **out** ticketId: string      // Generated ticket (output)
  ): boolean
}</pre>

    **in** licensePlate: string,  // Vehicle ID (input)
    **out** spotId: string,       // Assigned spot (output)
    **inout** vehicle: Vehicle    // Vehicle gets spot assigned (modified)
  ): boolean
}</pre>
>

### III. Payment Processing (Microservices)
><pre>class PaymentService {
  +processPayment(
    **in** orderId: string,       // Order details (input)
    **inout** payment: Payment    // Status updated: pending→success (modified)
  ): TransactionId
}</pre>
>

### IV. User Authentication

### 1️⃣ Association
![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250828094904229784/file.webp)

👉 Simple connection

> User → Order


✔ Represented by line

✔ Can have multiplicity

#### Code:- 
<pre>
class Product {
  constructor(
    public id: string,
    public name: string,
    public price: number
  ) {}
}

class Menu {
  constructor(public products: Product[]) {}
}

class Restaurant {
  constructor(
    public id: string,
    public name: string,
    public menu: Menu // association
  ) {}
}
</pre>

### 2️⃣ Multiplicity (Cardinality)
#### Examples:

| Notation | Meaning | Example |
| --------- | -------- | ------- |
|1 | Exactly one | A Person has exactly one SSN. |
| `0..1` | Zero or one (Optional) | A User may or may not have a MiddleName. |
| `*` | Zero or many | A Customer can have many Orders. |
| `1..*` | One or many (At least one) | A Team must have at least one Player. |
| `n` | Specific number | A Car has exactly 4 Wheels. |
| `m..n` | A specific range | A Player in a game has 3 to 5 Lives.|

#### 1. One to one relationship (1:1)
**One item** is connected to **only one other item**,
and **that item is also connected to only one in return**.

It is represented using an arrow(⇢,⇠)(There can be many notations possible for the ER diagram).

**Example:**
![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20231101160601/Untitleddrawing26-660x131.png)
In this ER diagram, both entities customer and driving license having an arrow which means the entity Customer is participating in the relation "has a" in a one-to-one fashion. It could be read as 'Each customer has exactly one driving license and every driving license is associated with exactly one customer.

**The set-theoretic perspective of the ER diagram is**
![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20231101160618/Untitleddrawing27-300x208.png)

There may be customers who do not have a credit card, but every credit card is associated with exactly one customer. Therefore, the entity customer has total participation in a relation.

#### 2. One to many relationship (1:M)
**One item** is connected to **many items**,
but each of those **many items is connected to only that one**.

**Example:**
![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20231101160634/Untitleddrawing31-660x255.png)
This relationship is one to many because "There are some employees who manage more than one team while there is only one manager to manage a team".

**The set-theoretic perspective of the ER diagram is:**
![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20231101161342/Untitleddrawing28300x225-200x150.png)

#### 3. Many to one relationship (M:1)
**Many items** from one group are connected to **just one item in another group**.

**Example:**

![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20231101161358/Untitleddrawing32-660x144.png)

This is a **one-to-many** relationship, but the difference comes from who must participate .The set-theoretic perspective of the ER diagram is:

- A customer can have many credit cards, but some customers might not have any. So, customer participation is partial.
- Every credit card must be linked to one customer. So, credit card participation is total.
- Also, a credit card belongs to only one customer — it cannot be shared by multiple customers.

![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20231101161414/Untitleddrawing29-300x221.png)

### 4. Many to many relationship (M:N)
**One entity** in the first set can be related to **many entities** in the second set,
and **One entity** in the second set can also be related to **many entities** in the first set.

**Example:**

A customer can buy any number of products and a product can be bought by many customers. 

![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20231101161515/Untitleddrawing34-660x260-(1).png)
The set-theoretic perspective of the ER diagram is:

![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20231101161533/Untitleddrawing30-300x223-(1).png)

Any of the four cardinalities of a binary relationship can have both sides partial, both total, and one partial, and one total participation, depending on the constraints specified by user requirements.

### 3️⃣ Aggregation (Weak HAS-A)
![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20190930035513/Aggregation.jpeg)

👉 Whole–part (independent)

> Team → Player

✔ Hollow diamond
#### Code:- (Restaurant has Products indirectly)
<pre>
class FoodPlatform {
  constructor(public restaurants: Restaurant[]) {}
}
</pre>
✔ Restaurants exist independently → aggregation

### 4️⃣ Composition (Strong HAS-A)
![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20190930035511/Aggregation-1.jpeg)

👉 Strong ownership

> Order → OrderItem


✔ Filled diamond <br>
✔ Child dies with parent
#### Code:-
<pre>
class OrderItem {
  constructor(
    public product: Product,
    public quantity: number
  ) {}

  getTotal(): number {
    return this.product.price * this.quantity;
  }
}

class Order {
  private items: OrderItem[] = []; // composition
  public status: OrderStatus = OrderStatus.CREATED;

  constructor(
    public id: string,
    public customer: Customer
  ) {}

  addItem(product: Product, quantity: number) {
    const item = new OrderItem(product, quantity);
    this.items.push(item);
  }

  getTotalAmount(): number {
    return this.items.reduce((sum, item) => sum + item.getTotal(), 0);
  }
}
</pre>

### 5️⃣ Inheritance (Generalization) 
![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20240308165524/Class-Diagram-example.webp)

👉 IS-A relationship

> Admin → User

✔ Triangle arrow

#### code:- 

<pre>
class User {
  constructor(
    public id: string,
    public name: string,
    public email: string
  ) {}

  login() {
    console.log(`${this.name} logged in`);
  }
}

class Customer extends User {
  placeOrder(order: Order) {
    console.log(`${this.name} placed order ${order.id}`);
  }
}

class DeliveryPartner extends User {
  deliverOrder(order: Order) {
    console.log(`Delivering order ${order.id}`);
  }
}
</pre>

### 6️⃣ Dependency
![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/0*OcXwbrcD2oInENr6.jpg)
👉 Uses temporarily

> OrderService → PaymentService

✔ Dashed arrow
#### Code:- (Service uses Payment)
<pre>
class PaymentService {
  processPayment(
    amount: number,
    method: PaymentMethod
  ): PaymentStatus {
    return method.pay(amount);
  }
}

class OrderService {
  constructor(private paymentService: PaymentService) {}

  checkout(order: Order, method: PaymentMethod) {
    const amount = order.getTotalAmount();
    const status = this.paymentService.processPayment(amount, method);

    if (status === PaymentStatus.SUCCESS) {
      order.status = OrderStatus.CONFIRMED;
    }
  }
}
</pre>

### 7️⃣ Realization
![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250829165046859312/realization.webp)
👉 Interface implementation

> Payment → PaymentMethod

✔ Dashed + triangle

#### Code:- 
<pre>
interface PaymentMethod {
  pay(amount: number): PaymentStatus;
}

class UPIPayment implements PaymentMethod {
  pay(amount: number): PaymentStatus {
    console.log("Paid via UPI:", amount);
    return PaymentStatus.SUCCESS;
  }
}

class CardPayment implements PaymentMethod {
  pay(amount: number): PaymentStatus {
    console.log("Paid via Card:", amount);
    return PaymentStatus.SUCCESS;
  }
}

</pre>

## 🧠 5. Advanced Concepts (from your PDF)
### 🔹 Association Class 

👉 Relationship with attributes

<pre>Example:

Student --- Enrollment --- Course</pre>

### 🔹 Qualified Association

👉 Reduce many-to-many

### 🔹 Enumeration 
![](https://www.softwareideas.net/i/DirectImage/1685/an-enumeration-associated-with-a-class-uml-class-diagram-)

<pre>enum OrderStatus {
  CREATED, PAID, SHIPPED
}</pre>

Code:-
<pre>
enum OrderStatus {
  CREATED = "CREATED",
  CONFIRMED = "CONFIRMED",
  PREPARING = "PREPARING",
  OUT_FOR_DELIVERY = "OUT_FOR_DELIVERY",
  DELIVERED = "DELIVERED"
}

enum PaymentStatus {
  PENDING = "PENDING",
  SUCCESS = "SUCCESS",
  FAILED = "FAILED"
}
</pre>

### 🔹 Abstract Class 

<pre><< abstract >>
Payment</pre>

### 🔹 Package

👉 Group of classes

### 🔹 Ordering / Sequence / Bag 

- Ordered collection

- Unordered collection

- Duplicates allowed

## 🧠 FINAL MAPPING (VERY IMPORTANT)
| UML Concept	| TypeScript |
| ---- | ---- |
| Class	| class |
| Attribute |	properties |
| Method |	functions |
| Inheritance |	extends |
| Realization |	implements |
| Association |	object reference |
| Aggregation |	injected reference |
| Composition |	created inside class |
| Dependency |	method parameter / service |

## 🏢 6. Real Example (E-commerce — Full Understanding)
<pre>
User
 ├── Cart
 │    └── CartItem
 │         └── Product
 └── Order
      └── OrderItem
           └── Product
      └── Payment

</pre>

#### Relationships:
<pre>
User → Order (1:N)

Order → OrderItem (Composition)

OrderItem → Product (Association)

Payment → PaymentMethod (Realization)
</pre>

## 🎯 7. When to Use Class Diagram

From your PDF + real world:

<pre>
✔ System design (LLD)
✔ Database design mapping
✔ API modeling
✔ Microservices contracts
</pre>

## ⚠️ 8. Common Mistakes (VERY IMPORTANT)

<pre>
❌ Too many fields in one class
❌ Missing relationships
❌ Using inheritance everywhere
❌ Mixing DB schema with UML
❌ No methods (only data)
</pre>

## 🧪 9. Interview-Level Answer (memorize this)

>Class diagram is a static UML diagram that represents the structure of a system using classes, their attributes, methods, and relationships such as association, inheritance, aggregation, and composition. It is mainly used for low-level design and object-oriented modeling.
